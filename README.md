# ImpedanceControl_OpenManipulator
A brief showcase for Impedance Control for the Open Manipulator Robot for the Advanced Robotics Course at UTEC.

This project is the result of the hard work of the following people:

- César Delgado
- Manuel Carita
- Elías Cabeza

ah ... and Jairo Custodio too.

# Remembering the impedance control law
It's known that the impedance control law is given by the following equation:

But the Open Manipulator doesn't have any force torque sensor, so we'll go for the model-based impedance control:
