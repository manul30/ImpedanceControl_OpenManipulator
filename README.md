# ImpedanceControl_OpenManipulator
A brief showcase for Impedance Control for the Open Manipulator Robot for the Advanced Robotics Course at UTEC.

This project is the result of the hard work of the following people:

- César Delgado (cesar.delgado@utec.edu.pe)
- Manuel Carita (manuel.carita@utec.edu.pe)
- Elías Cabeza (jose.cabeza@utec.edu.pe)

ah ... and Jairo Custodio (jairo.custodio@utec.edu.pe) too.

# Remembering the impedance control law
It's known that the impedance control law is given by the following equation:

But the Open Manipulator doesn't have any force torque sensor, so we'll go for the model-based impedance control:
